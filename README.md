## Project Overview  
This project implements an object detection model using YOLOv8 to classify and detect objects for two tasks:  
1. **Rock-Paper-Scissors**: Detects hand signs for the classic game rock-paper-scissors.  
2. **Manufacturing Items**: Identifies various items used in manufacturing processes.  

This model aims to provide robust detection capabilities enhancing automation in gaming and industrial applications.
