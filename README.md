## Project Overview  
This project implements an object detection model using YOLOv8 to classify and detect objects for two tasks:  
1. **Rock-Paper-Scissors**: Detects hand signs for the classic game rock-paper-scissors.  
2. **Manufacturing Items**: Identifies various items used in manufacturing processes.  

This model aims to provide robust detection capabilities enhancing automation in gaming and industrial applications.  

## Installation  
To set up the project, clone this repository and install the required packages. 
```bash  
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/repo-name.git  
cd repo-name  
pip install -r requirements.txt.
```
 
**Requirements**
- Roboflow
- Ultralytics

## Usage
You can use the provided scripts to run inference or train the model on your datasets.

**Run Inference**

To run inference on an image or video, use the following command:
```bash  
python inference.py --source path/to/your/image_or_video
```

**Train the Model**

To train the model on your custom dataset, use the following command:
```bash  
!yolo task=detect mode=train model=yolov8n.pt data=data.yaml epochs=10 imgsz=640 plots=True
```

## Dataset
Provide information about the datasets used:

- **Rock-Paper-Scissors dataset**: Describe the dataset, including the number of images, classes, and how to obtain it (e.g., a link to download).
- **Manufacturing items dataset**: Same as above.
Make sure to include instructions on how to structure the dataset and any preprocessing steps that might be necessary.

## Training
Explain how to properly set up for training:

- Specify the config files (like data.yaml and model architecture).
- Discuss augmentation techniques used during training.
- Provide details on hyperparameters you used and any noteworthy experiments.

## Evaluation
Outline how to evaluate the model's performance:

- Metrics used (mAP, precision, recall).
- Example commands to evaluate on the validation dataset:
```bash  
!yolo task=detect mode=val model=/content/runs/detect/train/weights/best.pt data=data.yaml
```

## Results
Present the evaluation results quantitatively and visually. Include:

- Sample images with detected objects annotated.
- A summary of mAP scores and other metrics for both tasks.
- Discuss insights or observations from the results.
